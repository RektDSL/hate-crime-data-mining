Welcome to the **Hate Crime Data Mining** project. This repository focuses on analyzing hate crime patterns in the United States from 2017 to 2025. Through data mining techniques like clustering, predictive modeling, and association rule mining, we aim to uncover insights that can inform policy and community action.

## Project Overview

Hate crimes have significant social implications. By analyzing these incidents, we can identify trends, hotspots, and factors that contribute to such crimes. This project leverages various data mining techniques to provide a clearer picture of hate crime dynamics in the U.S.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/RektDSL/hate-crime-data-mining/releases). You will find the necessary files to run the analysis. 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `geopandas`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn geopandas
```

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is sourced from various government databases and public records. The main sources include:

- FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program
- The Bureau of Justice Statistics
- Open data portals from state and local governments

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Incident ID**: Unique identifier for each hate crime incident
- **Date**: Date of the incident
- **Location**: Geographical location of the incident
- **Type**: Type of hate crime (e.g., racial, religious, sexual orientation)
- **Victim Demographics**: Information about the victims
- **Offender Demographics**: Information about the offenders
- **Law Enforcement Agency**: Reporting agency

## Tech Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Geopandas**: For geospatial analysis.

## Methods

### Clustering

We use clustering algorithms to identify patterns and group similar hate crime incidents. K-means clustering is one of the primary methods employed in this analysis.

### Predictive Modeling

Predictive modeling helps us forecast future hate crime incidents based on historical data. We implement classification algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

### Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining uncovers relationships between different variables in the dataset. This method helps us understand how various factors interact with each other.

## Results

The results of our analysis provide valuable insights into hate crime trends. Some key findings include:

- **Geographical Hotspots**: Certain areas experience a higher frequency of hate crimes.
- **Time Trends**: Specific times of the year show increased incidents.
- **Demographic Patterns**: Certain demographic groups are more frequently targeted.

Visualizations created during the analysis illustrate these findings clearly.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/RektDSL/hate-crime-data-mining/releases).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

### Example Command

```bash
jupyter notebook hate_crime_analysis.ipynb
```
